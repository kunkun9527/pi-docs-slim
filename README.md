[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A [Pi](https://pi.dev) extension that keeps Pi's built-in documentation guidance out of the system prompt. When you actually have a question about Pi itself, ask it with `/pi` and the guidance comes back for that one run.

This is a fork of [robzolkos/pi-slim](https://github.com/robzolkos/pi-slim) by Rob Zolkos. The idea and the `/pi` command come from his extension. The fork exists mainly to make it work on newer Pi versions.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@ssk_dev/pi-docs-slim
```

If you have the original `pi-slim` installed, remove it first. Both register a `/pi` command.

Requires Pi 0.87.1 or newer (tested on 0.87.1 and 1.0.0).

## Usage

- Normal requests: Pi's documentation guidance is removed from what the model sees.
- `/pi <question about Pi>`: this run keeps the guidance, including its tool-call turns. The next normal request goes back to removing it.
- Your own `<docs>` blocks, project instructions, and code examples are left alone. User messages, assistant replies, and tool output are never touched.

After installing or updating, run `/reload`, send a normal message, and check `/context`.

## Why fork instead of the original

The original 0.2.1 removes the docs by replacing a string in the system prompt. Starting with Pi 0.87.1, the system prompt is built from structured sections and saved as system messages, so that replacement no longer takes effect: the docs still reach the model (see [pi-slim#3](https://github.com/robzolkos/pi-slim/issues/3)).

What this fork changes:

- **Removes the docs from the new structured prompt.** It blocks Pi from filling the docs section back in, and cleans the system messages before they are saved and before they are sent.
- **Cleans old history too.** Docs left over from an earlier `/pi` run are stripped from later normal requests.
- **Keeps `/context` accurate.** [pi-context-view](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-context-view) shows the cleaned prompt, not the original.
- **Makes `/pi` reliable.** The "keep docs" permission is tied to the exact request `/pi` sends, so it can't leak into your next message if that request gets intercepted.
- **Doesn't freeze the prompt.** Tools and rules added later by other extensions still show up.
- **Adds offline integration tests.** They run real Pi sessions with an offline model provider, so no model service is called.

No new runtime dependencies.

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

The tests need Pi 0.87.1+ and pi-context-view 0.6.0 installed. They look for the global Pi and `~/.pi/agent/npm/node_modules/pi-context-view` by default. For other locations, point to the package roots:

```bash
PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR=/path/to/pi-coding-agent PI_CONTEXT_VIEW_DIR=/path/to/pi-context-view npm test
```

Set `PI_SLIM_ENTRY` to run the suite against another implementation.

## Limits

- Old session files aren't rewritten. `/context`'s Usage view is clean after the next normal request. The Initial view is a snapshot from the first request; reload to refresh it. If that first request was `/pi`, it will include the docs, which is expected.
- If the model reads Pi's docs with a tool, that output is kept.
- The cleanup relies on Pi 0.87.1's event order. Rerun the tests after upgrading Pi. If another extension re-injects the docs after the final context step, they won't be removed.
